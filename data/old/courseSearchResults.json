Students will receive an in-depth overview of Lean manufacturing principles and will perform case studies at local industries to implement learned skill-sets. Next, students will step-through several hands-on activities using real products to investigate six-sigma and perform SPC analysis, identifying shifts in process data and learning how to shift processes into capable processes. Lastly, students will learn about various implementation techniques for industry and will perform an in-depth analysis of the course topics based on the industry tours performed.

So often, these processes are thought of as being quick, easy, and cheap.  While this can be true for prototypes and other non-critical parts, the reality is much different when working with engineered parts.  An examination of the underlying engineering details for AM processes reveals many elements of cost and time which must be accounted for when evaluating the affordability of AM for any application.  Students will learn about recurring and non-recurring costs, the reasons for post-processing steps such as machining, mechanical testing, and non-destructive inspection, and the impacts of these considerations on cost and manufacturing span-time.  Students should expect to come away from this course better equipped to assess the economic viability of AM for engineering applications.",

These will range from efficient study techniques, memory recall, focus, efficient study and productivity strategies, time management and many others. Research in student success, how people learn, and human behavior indicates that simply teaching a person many ways to study or manage their time does not always result in long term changes. To complement the academic success strategies we teach, Bounce Back also explores many underlying factors related to success both in and out of the classroom.

      "courseDescription": "Plants, bacteria, and algae have evolved over billions of years to efficiently use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into useful chemicals, a potential solution to the very real problem of climate change. How do they do this? How can we take advantage of these processes? And, how can we improve on them to find practical solutions to address climate change? The purpose of this course is to answer these questions by introducing students to bioconversion, nature&#39;s ability to convert CO2 into other molecules. In this online, asynchronous course, students will work collaboratively in small teams to discuss current literature on carbon dioxide bioconversion, evaluate the effects of various parameters on bioconversion rates and efficiencies, and design and present case studies on ways to use plants, algae, and bacteria to convert CO2 to useful material.

      "courseDescription": "The heart (or, perhaps more appropriately, the stomach) of any chemical manufacturing or refining process is the reactor, where chemical and physical transformations occur under precisely controlled conditions. For traditional industrial chemical processes, the design, optimization and operation of conventional chemical reactors are extremely well developed, drawing upon the principles of chemistry, physics, calculus and economics. However, new-age process concepts proposing to use &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; reactors and/or sustainable inputs (e.g., renewable carbon resources, electrons, photons, plasma) face a dearth of well documented reaction engineering principles &amp; design practices that eclipses their rapid adoption. CBEN 428/528 course features a survey of conventional and emerging non-conventional reactors to prepare students for career paths in applied academic or industrial research &amp; development environments. For each reactor type, we introduce the geometry, transport limitations, fluid contacting patterns and options for heat management. Building on these fundamentals, we assess strategies for each reactor&rsquo;s scale-up, connecting first principles to practical laboratory and reactor simulation approaches to target the information required to deploy the technology. In all cases, we emphasize conceptual reactor design requirements instead of mechanical details. Class time generally features whiteboard lectures and collaborative case studies of real-world reaction engineering examples. Prerequisites: CBEN418 or equivalent (instructor may make special exemptions).",

This course will equip students and researchers with the knowledge to develop and apply advanced optical microscopy and imaging in their research. The course will cover the theoretical aspects which underlie optical imaging, including optical theory, fluorescence, and the interaction of light with matter. The course will then discuss the various technologies that are utilized in optical imaging, including microscopy, fluorophores including fluorescent proteins, optical biosensors, lasers, optical detectors, optical sectioning technology, and quantitative analysis of fluorescent images. The principle of operation of these technologies will be covered as well as assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the course will introduce a number of advanced optical imaging technologies and techniques which are increasingly being applied in biomedical research and will include hands on demonstrations of fluorescence microscopy.",

There is a strong focus on the underlying principles of kinetics and equilibrium, and their general applicability, strongly rooted in the first and second law of thermodynamics. Examples of these principles come primarily from solid-state systems. Laboratory experiments emphasize conceptual understanding of structure-property relationships through both hands-on and computational analysis, reinforced by quantitative chemical measurements.

We also briefly cover special topics, such as metallo-endocrinology, extremophiles, biomineralization, and supramolecular bioinorganic chemistry. We investigate recent advances in the field of bioinorganic chemistry, introduce many leading scientists in the field, and explore scientific literature. Students are assessed through two open-resource, take-home exams (midterm and final) covering course material. Students also explore a topic of their choice through a class presentation and a writing assignment. Students will benefit from having taken at least one of the following courses: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, or biochemistry.",

These elements are key components of nearly all electronic devices, and you are currently using about eight of them if you are reading this on a cellphone or computer. They also possess fascinating and complex chemistry that can be quite different from transition metals. The course will start with a history of their discovery and the developments that took place during the Manhattan Project. The course will then continue with fundamentals of f-block chemistry with a focus on electronic structure and thermodynamics. Following this, other core topics will include: 1) environmental chemistry including efforts to remediate Cold War legacy nuclear sites and how chemistry plays a role in this. 2) Aqueous Chemistry. 3) Coordination chemistry. 4) Optical and magnetic properties and the selection rules that determine these phenomena. 5) Catalysis, including small molecule activation and polymerization. 5) Separations and recycling. 6) Nuclear Medicine. Each year the course will be partially tailored to recent discoveries and adjusted in focus based on class interests.",

We investigate recent advances in the field of bioinorganic chemistry, introduce many leading scientists in the field, and explore scientific literature. Students are assessed through two open-resource, take-home exams (midterm and final) covering course material. Students also explore a topic of their choice through a class presentation and a writing assignment.  There are no formal prerequisites for the class; however, students will benefit from having taken at least one of the following courses: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, or biochemistry.",

These elements are key components of nearly all electronic devices, and you are currently using about eight of them if you are reading this on a cellphone or computer. They also possess fascinating and complex chemistry that can be quite different from transition metals. The course will start with a history of their discovery and the developments that took place during the Manhattan Project. The course will then continue with fundamentals of f-block chemistry with a focus on electronic structure and thermodynamics. Following this, other core topics will include: 1) environmental chemistry including efforts to remediate Cold War legacy nuclear sites and how chemistry plays a role in this. 2) Aqueous Chemistry. 3) Coordination chemistry. 4) Optical and magnetic properties and the selection rules that determine these phenomena. 5) Catalysis, including small molecule activation and polymerization. 5) Separations and recycling. 6) Nuclear Medicine. Each year the course will be partially tailored to recent discoveries and adjusted in focus based on class interests.",

This career-oriented course focuses on the roles &amp; responsibilities, skills, and character of the Project Engineer as a problem-solver, integrator, and leader. Content, procedural, and relationship project needs essential for project execution success are identified. Practical instruction and exercises are given - formulated around industry documents and templates - on key project execution best practices such as estimating (cost, weight, etc.), scheduling, quality, earned value, constructability, risk management, and root-cause analysis. Emotional Intelligence is introduced along with identification of skills that are essential for leading projects and people to success. Management, leadership, and ethical principles and best practices are illustrated through case studies of complex, high-profile domestic and international projects. Prior to taking the course, design and analysis courses along with any project/construction management experience beneficial but not expected. Courses recommended concurrently include courses equivalent to CEEN591, CEEN594, EBGN553, and MNGN509 are advantageous but not required. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours. Prerequisite: CEEN360.",

      "courseDescription": "Soil and rock are among the most variable of all engineering materials, and as such are highly amenable to a probabilistic treatment. Assessment of the probability of failure or inadequate performance is rapidly gaining ground on the traditional factor of safety approach as a more rational approach to design decision making and risk management. Probabilistic concepts are also closely related to system reliability and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). When probability is combined with consequences of failure, this leads to the concept of risk. This course is about the theory and application of various tools enabling risk assessment in engineering with an emphasis on geotechnical applications",
