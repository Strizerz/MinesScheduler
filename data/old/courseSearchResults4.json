This course provides an overview of how earthquake seismology, complemented by geodesy and tectonic geomorphology, can be used to determine Earth structure, earthquake locations, depths and mechanisms; understand Earth&#39;s tectonics and rheology; establish long-term earthquake histories and forecast future recurrence; and mitigate against seismic hazards. GPGN555 differs from GPGN455 in that the assignments are approximately 20% longer and encompass more challenging questions. GPGN555 is the appropriate course for graduate students and for undergraduates who expect to go on to study earthquake seismology at graduate school. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.",

How do you use this information in exploration, production and basic volumetric and economics calculations? The course will go over these topics. Students will work in teams on several modeling and seismic field data exercises around the world in most widely used software platforms (Ikon-RokDoc, Schlumberger-Petrel, GEOX, CGG-HampsonRussell).

We will cover topics including glacier mass balance, ice material properties, ice rheology, models of ice ﬂow, supra-, en-, and subglacial hydrology, subglacial geologic processes, and the stability and history of Earth&#39;s ice sheets. Although aimed at a broad audience interested in climate, geophysics, and planetary science, students will be expected to have a background understanding of undergraduate-level mathematics through differential equations and basic Python programming experience.

Techniques discussed include reverse-time migration and migration by wavefield extrapolation, angle-domain imaging, migration velocity analysis and analysis of angle-dependent reflectivity. Students do independent term projects presented at the end of the term, under the supervision of a faculty member or guest lecturer. Prerequisite: none. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.",

These courses are open to students from the first to senior years, and students must apply to engage in a specific project in a given semester. Decisions on acceptance will be made by the faculty advisors for the project, in consultation with the Co-Directors of the VIPER Program. Students must commit to at least three semesters of participation. Students should check with their departments regarding the counting of VIP credits towards their degree program.",

Students spend 3-4 hours per week serving the organization they choose and meet in class once per week to discuss reading assignments, present research findings, and share experiences and insights about the course material.  Instructors may choose to focus on a particular topic or social issue, such as poverty and privilege, or may engage with community issues more broadly.  The course focuses on several aspects of a student&rsquo;s learning, including intra- and interpersonal learning, discovering community, and developing communication skills and critical and interdisciplinary approaches. Course work will focus on critical reading, group discussion and deliberation, oral presentations of research, and writing assignments. Prerequisites: none. 2 hours lecture; 3-4 hours lab; 3.0 semester hours.",

In much the same way, the research done at Mines has far reaching implications for many of the social, economic, and environmental challenges faced around the world. To develop these relationships, and to prepare students for future roles, the Payne Institute partnered with students to develop a public policy community that uses all the School of Mines&rsquo; resources to be both physical and social engineers of the world around them. One of the most prominent ways we do this is through the Payne Scholars program. This one-credit course helps students perform research, collaborate across campus, and engage with a broad network of international experts on global policy challenges. Students are taught how to write academic papers on the important issues we are facing today, and once the students finish the course, the papers they write can be published as Payne Commentaries on our website. We often sponsor students for internships, or offer student worker positions to continue their work. This often means that they get to be co-authors on peer-reviewed academic papers or help us build world-shaping policy.",

Students will study various forms of science communication, including essays, blogs, news segments, media clips, and radio programs in order to understand the ways in which science is communicated beyond the lab or university and into the public consciousness. Science writing often explores the human condition, reflects on hopes and worries about technology, and informs our collective knowledge about the world. Students will discuss the implications of this kind of communication, analyze breakdowns in communication through case studies, and write for peer and popular audiences, including turning a lab report into a short feature article and writing a science essay. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.

Instructors may choose to focus on a particular topic or social issue, such as poverty and privilege, or may engage with community issues more broadly.  The course focuses on several aspects of a student&#39;s learning, including intra- and interpersonal learning, discovering community, and developing communication skills and critical and interdisciplinary approaches.

Topics analyzed include: prose and narrative theory, organizational approaches to fiction, plot, character, setting, and all the many aspects of professional creative writing. Critical prose writing by the students will examine the development of the short story from inception to contemporary approaches. Analysis of historical trends and change will also serve as a basis for developing student writing habits and strategies. Over the course of the semester, these subjects will be addressed through seminars, readings, workshops, and in-class discussion and activities. Students will advance their own literary fiction-writing skills, which will be demonstrated in two new short stories over the course of the semester, and will turn in a final portfolio and critical paper to show their growth.

Students will learn to analyze and interpret visual culture in order to understand how cinematic narratives have shaped our societal understandings of the so-called &quot;natural&quot; world and our engagement with energy sources. By examining competing stories that embed different messages about what audiences should think, feel, and do in order to balance energy needs against environmental crises, students in the class will be able to answer the following questions: In what ways are terms like &quot;nature&quot; and the &quot;environment&quot; constructed, and how do these constructions substantively change not only environmental imaginaries but the lived experience of global citizens? How have the cultural and historical contexts in which environmental discourses have been produced affected the production and reception of those narratives and the people who perpetuate them? How do representations of the environment and energy on film impact popular opinions and inflect the ways in which we are able to communicate politically on individual, national, and global scales? This class explores the ways in which films convey competing narratives about the relationship between humans and the environment. Prerequisites: HASS100. Corequisites: HASS215.",

Relationships between the works of novelists, local nationalisms, and state politics have, however, always been volatile. These tensions have assumed particularly dramatic expressive and political forms in Latin America and postcolonial South Asia and Africa. This course examines the inspirations, stakes, and ramifications of celebrated novelists&#39; explorations of the conflicted and fragmentary character their own and/or neighboring nationstates. Beyond their intrinsic literary values, these texts illuminate distinctive religious, ritual, and popular cultural practices that have shaped collective imaginings of the nation, as well as oscillations in nationalist sentiment across specific regions and historical junctures. Studies in relevant visual media -films, paintings, and telenovelas - will further our comparative inquiry into the relationships between artistic narrative and critical perspectives on &quot;the nation.&quot; Alongside the focal literary and visual texts, the course will address major historians&#39; and social theorists&#39; accounts of the origins, spread, and varied careers of nationalist thought and practice across our modern world. 3 hours seminar; 3 semester hours.

For our purposes, we will focus on any contemporary literature that investigates the plausible and implausible future of technology, science, culture, and society. This course will endeavor to develop student skills in reading, writing, critical thinking, and oral communication by having them deeply read and discuss speculative literature as a genre and will require participation in (and submissions to) our creative writing workshop. Writing and communication skills will be improved through the exploration of selected topics related to the social, cultural, and political ideas that are featured in literature of the future, and we will use the role of the creative literary arts and research in our understanding of the futures we create.

This course explores multiple perspectives on that overarching question. Although risk perception, risk management, and risk communication are three major course components, they are not treated separately but in terms of how they interrelate. Case studies include engineers and applied scientists coping with complex forms of uncertainty and risk, communicating in organizational and public sphere contexts with multiple audiences via the press and directly to the public, stockholders, co-workers, local communities, and more. In addition, students will critically reflect on the social consequences of living with risk in our contemporary moment. 3 hours seminar; 3 semester hours. Prerequisite: HASS100.

We will explore the general psychological lenses through which human thoughts, feelings, and behavior are studied and understood including behavioral, cognitive, developmental, humanistic, and social perspectives. Students will learn how psychological principles and knowledge can be applied to investigate and solve real-world problems such as how to make technology more inviting, reliable, useful, and safe. Gaining a better understanding of how humans think, feel, and behave can also be useful in our personal lives, thus this course will also focus on supporting students in navigating their own environments and careers by examining meaningful topics such as human learning and development, motivation, stress and health, and personality and society.

Students in this class will be expected to read both classical Confucian texts such as Analects and Mencius and works by contemporary authors that examine the social, ethical, and political issues in scientific and technological domains such as gene editing technology, robotics, social media technology, and engineering through the lens of Confucian ethics. A major goal of this course is to help students challenge some prevalent ideologies in Western ethics such as autonomous individualism (e.g., individuals are understood as merely rights-bearing persons). It also helps students cultivate a cultural sensitivity toward scientific and technological practice in a global context. Our exploration in this class will help students develop their self-knowledge that has been extensively missing in current engineering education system. Students are encouraged to think reflectively and critically about why they are engineers, for those benefit they want to work, and the kind of world they want to design and live in by using the powerful technologies they create.

Is the universe a mindless machine? What does quantum mechanics teach us about this? What is the connection between mind and matter? (Does mind matter? Does matter mind?) Why can humans be devils or saints? What are the roles of rational thinking and intuition?

It engages with governance questions such as how we are to share over-allocated water resources, how we are to engage with increasingly unpredictable hydrologic dynamics, and how changes in water science, engineering, and values shape policy and politics and vice versa.  The course engages with concepts in ethics, economics, history, law, and policy, and puts them in conversation with dynamics in hydrology, engineering, and social-ecological systems theory.

      "courseDescription": "This course presents a comprehensive survey of the U.S. Constitution with special attention devoted to the first ten Amendments, also known as the Bill of Rights. Since the Constitution is primarily a legal document, the class will adopt a legal approach to constitutional interpretation. However, as the historical and political context of constitutional interpretation is inseparable from the legal analysis, these areas will also be covered. Significant current developments in constitutional jurisprudence will also be examined. The first part of the course deals with Articles I through III of the Constitution, which specify the division of national governmental power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Additionally, the federal nature of the American governmental system, in which governmental authority is apportioned between the national government and the state governments, will be studied. The second part of the course examines the individual rights specifically protected by the amendments to the Constitution, principally the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

This course will familiarize students with the complexities of contemporary water governance, using the Colorado River system as its central case study. The Colorado River makes for an excellent point of departure because it is one of the most dammed, diverted, legislated, litigated, and loved rivers in the world and because we literally use it up; the river has seldom reached the sea since the 1960s.  Indeed, the challenges that face the Colorado River&#39;s 40 million stakeholders today have less to do with applying law and engineering to developing water resources, and much more to do with figuring out how to share an over-appropriated resource while mitigating the social and ecological consequences of past choices.  Our primary goal in the course will be to learn concepts of adaptive governance that provide a constructive and framework for analyzing and addressing such challenges.  3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.",

Topics will include nonlinear dynamics, hysteresis, the cable equation, and representative models such as Wilson-Cowan, Hodgkin-Huxley, and FitzHugh-Nagumo. Applications will be motivated by student interests. In addition to building basic skills in applied math, students will gain insight into how mathematical sciences can be used to model and solve problems in neuroscience; develop a variety of strategies (computational, theoretical, etc.) with which to approach novel mathematical situations; and hone skills for communicating mathematical ideas precisely and concisely in an interdisciplinary context. In addition, the strong computational component of this course will help students to develop computer programming skills and apply appropriate technological tools to solve mathematical problems.

Practically, it enables students to solve real-world mechanical behavior problems that involve structural materials. This courses places an early focus on ensuring students have mastered the creation of free body diagrams given a mechanical system, then moves on to introduce and reinforce learning of stress and strain transformations, and failure theories. In practicing this knowledge, students will be able to analyze and design machine elements and structures of homogenous and heterogeneous geometries under axial, torsional, bending, transverse shear, internal pressure loads, and non-uniform loads. Students will be able to quantitatively communicate the outcomes. May not also receive credit for CEEN311. Prerequisite: CEEN241 (C- or better).",

Students will work interactively with the instructor and with their peers to complete hands-on FEA examples based primarily on problems in structural mechanics. Applications of FEA for heat conduction, natural frequency analysis, and design optimization are covered briefly. The course will conclude with a mini project on which students use FEA skills for engineering analysis and design. The importance of verification and validation (V&amp;V) for critical evaluation of FEA predictions is emphasized, and students will make frequent use of statics and solid mechanics principles to corroborate their FEA results.
