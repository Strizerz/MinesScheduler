Any student who cannot take the course for valid reasons should notify their adviser, who will then make a request to the EE graduate committee for a waiver. These requests could be for the duration of one semester or longer. The course will be graded as PRG/PRU based on student attendance at the department seminars in the colloquium series - the student has to attend at least two thirds of all the seminars each semester in order to get a PRG grade.",

Students assess the success of a prior design solution using engineering analysis, relative impacts, identiﬁcation of the assumptions shaping the solution approach, and the eﬀectiveness of supporting communications to relevant audiences. They also apply these skills to future oriented problem solving by crafting a design prompt for an idealized sociotechnical engineering design project. Prerequisites: EDNS310.",

This course will provide learners with a survey of how institutions from governments, donors, to public and private organizations are quickly pivoting from a world of &lsquo;sustainable development goals&rsquo; to one of resilience, remediation, and adaptation at national, subnational, and local scales, and how sociotechnical perspectives can support their participation in this new world. At the end of this eight-week course, learners will be able to assess and answer the following questions: [1] what is &#39;community resilience&#39; and how do different communities, stakeholders, and sectors define it, [2] how does new terminology around &lsquo;resilience&rsquo; relate to previous humanitarian efforts aimed at sustainable community development, [3] what are significant sociotechnical pillars of resilience, including built infrastructure and the environment, social infrastructure and governance, [4] how can mainstream efforts aimed at resilience lead to inequality and perpetuate systemic power imbalance.

They are the largest source of W and Sn, and also a significant source of Au, Ag, B, Cu, Fe, Mo, Pb, Zn, Pb, Mo, plus U, REE and other rare metals. This course will introduce to students all aspects of skarns and skarn deposits, including the geological features (e.g., geological context, host rock packages, alteration assemblages, mineralization styles, paragenesis and zonations), formation processes and evolution (e.g., magma fertility, magma-hydrothermal transition, fluid composition, fluid-rock reactions, plus metal sources, transportation, deposition and enrichment), investigation and research methods, the relationship between skarns and other types of deposits (porphyry, epithermal, carbonate replacement, Carlin type, SEDEX, MVT, VHMS, orogenic, and IOCG deposits), and exploration methods. The course has a significant lab/field skill component with representative skarn samples from all over the world and intensive hands-on training on skarn alteration-mineralization and texture recognization and interpretation, plus a field trip to one of the skarns in Colorado or nearby states. Prerequisites: GEGN307, GEGN316, GEGN401 and GEOL321.\n",

The class will be split up in groups of students with similar interests. In the first part of the course, we take an introductory two-day field trip, and students will review existing literature and maps and write a brief research proposal including hypotheses, tests and a work plan for the remainder of the course. The second part of the course will focus on field work. During the last part of the course, students prepare a geological map and appropriate cross sections, and a report presenting rock descriptions, structural analysis, a geological history, and interpretation of results in the context of the hypotheses posed. Prerequisites: (need previous field experience such as a field course, and a course in structural geology and one in earth materials). 2 hours lecture, 6 hours lab; 4 semester hours.",

Students work on projects from the geophysical engineering practice in which they analyze (process, model, visualize) data. In their projects, students encounter limitations and uncertainties in data and learn quantitative means for handling them. They learn how to analyze errors in data, and their effects on data interpretation and decision making. 3 lecture hours; 3 semester hours. Prerequisite: CSCI128.",

They are also our most accessible source of information on Earth&#39;s structure, rheology and tectonics, which are what ultimately govern the distribution of its natural resources. This course provides an overview of how earthquake seismology, complemented by geodesy and tectonic geomorphology, can be used to determine earthquake locations, depths and mechanisms; understand Earth&#39;s tectonics and rheology; establish long-term earthquake histories and forecast future recurrence; mitigate against seismic hazards; illuminate large- and fine-scale features of Earth&#39;s interior using earthquake data. Students will also cover the recent developments in 3D numerical earthquake source and wave propagation modelling as well as common &amp; modern seismic data formats and processing/visualization tools and techniques used in earthquake seismology. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.

When you look at seismic data, how does it relate to the rock properties, what do the amplitudes mean, what is tuning, what is a wavelet, how does the seismic relate to structure, and what are seismic attributes and inversion products? How do you use this information in exploration, production and basic volumetric and economics calculations? The course will go over these topics. Students will work in teams on several modeling and seismic field data exercises around the world in most widely used software platforms (Ikon-RokDoc, Schlumberger-Petrel, GEOX, CGG-HampsonRussell). The course aims to give participants knowledge and information to assist in professional and career development and to be operationally prepared for the work environment. Prerequisites: GPGN461.",
